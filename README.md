# Computer networks - HTTP

This project was created as part of the University of Warsaw's Computer networks course.

The repository contains a simple C program to test WWW sites, by checking if the returned status is `200` or not. It also contains a `testhttp` script that allows testing of HTTPS sites by using `stunnel` program.

The exact description of the task (in Polish) can be found in the [task.pdf](task.pdf) file.
